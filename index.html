<p>Crowd-sourcing is not something new. It has been there for some time. This is an attempt to create a platform to explore the power of crowd-sourcing within an organization. This platform allows the project owners to publish tasks to a bigger forum. People from any of the units can pick up the tasks and start working on the tasks.</p>

<p>But how do we motivate the people from other units to contribute? The answer is 'gamification'. </p>

<h3>
<a name="steps" class="anchor" href="#steps"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep the work units as small as possible to start with</li>
<li>Allocate points for each of the tasks</li>
<li>Based on the review by the project owner, the contributor gets portion of 'task points' for the completed tasks</li>
<li>Publish the top 5 contributors details (along with photo) on your dashboard to keep the competition alive. </li>
</ul>
