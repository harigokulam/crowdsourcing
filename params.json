It has been there for some time. This is an attempt to create a platform to explore the power of crowd-sourcing within an organization. This platform allows the project owners to publish tasks to a bigger forum. People from any of the units can pick up the tasks and start working on the tasks.\r\n\r\nBut how do we motivate the people from other units to contribute? The answer is 'gamification'. \r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n* Keep the work units as small as possible to start with\r\n* Allocate points for each of the tasks\r\n* Based on the review by the project owner, the contributor gets portion of 'task points' for the completed tasks\r\n* Publish the top 5 contributors details (along with photo) on your dashboard to keep the competition alive. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
