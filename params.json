It has been there for some time. But, can we use this inside an IT organization? This is an attempt to create a platform to explore the power of crowd-sourcing within an organization. The _combination of Crowd-sourcing and Gamification_ might even change the way IT Organizations operate.\r\n\r\nThis platform allows the project owners to publish tasks to a bigger forum. People from any of the units can pick up the tasks and start working.\r\n\r\nBut, how do we motivate the people from other units to contribute? The answer is **'Gamification'**. \r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n* Keep the work units as small as possible to start with\r\n* Allocate points for each of the tasks\r\n* Based on the review by the task owner, the contributor gets portion of 'task points' for the completed tasks\r\n* Publish the top 5 contributors details (along with photo) on your dashboard to keep the competition alive. \r\n\r\n### What to crowd-source?\r\n...\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n....\r\n\r\n### Technology stack\r\n* AngularJS\r\n* Twitter Bootstrap\r\n* NodeJS + ExpressJS\r\n* MongoDB\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
